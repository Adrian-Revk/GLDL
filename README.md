GLDL : OpenGL Debug Library
============================
Author(s) : Adrian 'Revk' Dubouchet <greunne@gmail.com>

GLDL is an OpenGL Core Profile loading library that adds a debug layer in between.
It works as GLEW or gl3w would work as a statically linked library (or by directly adding the GLDL source files in your project). It's a temporary remplacement of one of those, and should be used for Debug only.
Like gl3w do it, GLDL will download the gl3.h header from the Khronos OpenGL website and generates the code needed for function loading and debug, with a script.

This is my work project of my *Analyse et Comprehension de Programmes* class at the _Universite de Montreal_ for this session.
